                <h2>My favorite Planet of the Apes film.</h2>
                <p>My favorite film from the original Planet of the Apes franchise is <cite>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</cite>. My favorite quote from the film is:</p>
                <audio controls src="./_audio/ceaser.mp3"></audio>
                <blockquote>
                    Where there is fire, there is smoke. And, in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of man's downfall.
                    The day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble.
                    When the sea is a dead sea and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity. And we shall build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans,
                    except to serve our ends. And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you... now!
                </blockquote>

        <p>Often, I study the philosophy of films, ranging from all sorts of concepts.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Metaphysics.</dt>
            <dd>the branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space.</dd>
            <dt>Ontology.</dt>
            <dd>the morality of an action is based on whether that action itself is right or wrong rather than based on the consequences of the action</dd>
            <dt>Pragmatism</dt>
            <dd>an approach that assesses the truth of meaning of theories or beliefs in terms of the success of their practical application.</dd>
